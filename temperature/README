These are the openHAB temperature icon converted to dynamic icons.
Currently, only Farenheit icons are present but the Celsius set is
in progress (though see below).

Note that openHAB cannot usnegative numbers for dynamic items (yet).
This is an issue for the Celsius scale since users are more likely to
see negative temperatures. This can be solved by using expressions
to select the correct icon name explicitly rather than using openHAB's
built-in dynamic selection feature.
