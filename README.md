# openHAB Dynamic Icons

This is a collection of dynamic icons for use with openHAB. To install them, copy the individual .svg files to your `$OPENHAB_CONF/icons/classic/` directory. 

The following icon sets were adapted from the openHAB default icons:

* motion
* temperaturef

The rest were drawn by hand. For the various lighting icons I adopted the color set used by openHAB's default light icon.
